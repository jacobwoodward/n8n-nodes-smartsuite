## Security

### Known Vulnerabilities

This node has some known security vulnerabilities in its dependencies:

1. **High Severity**: Axios SSRF and Credential Leakage Vulnerability
   - Affects: `axios` package (transitive dependency)
   - Impact: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and credential leakage
   - Mitigation: This vulnerability only affects requests to untrusted URLs. The SmartSuite node only makes requests to the SmartSuite API (a trusted domain) and handles credentials securely through n8n's credential system.

### Security Best Practices

1. **API Key Management**
   - Never share your SmartSuite API key
   - Use n8n's credential system to store your API key securely
   - Rotate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised

2. **Data Access**
   - Only grant the minimum required permissions to your SmartSuite API key
   - Review your SmartSuite audit logs regularly for suspicious activity
   - Use the principle of least privilege when setting up API access

3. **Network Security**
   - Ensure your n8n instance is running behind a secure network
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Keep your n8n instance and its dependencies up to date

### Reporting Security Issues
